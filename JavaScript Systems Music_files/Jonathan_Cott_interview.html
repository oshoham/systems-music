<p><b>Interview with Steve Reich </b><br>
    <i>by Jonathan Cott</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: I&rsquo;d like to ask you about several basic elements in your musical
  thought that manifest themselves in your works. And the first of these is <i>pulsation</i>.
  According to the poet William Blake, all great events start with &ldquo;the
  pulsation of an artery.&rdquo; So do the events of your musical compositions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: It&rsquo;s hard to imagine pulsation being the least bit out of the ordinary
  in music. But in the academic world that I studied in from 1957 to 1963, the
  prevailing works of that time, written by Stockhausen, Boulez, Berio and Cage,
  were nonpulsatile &ndash; there was no regular beat. There was a simultaneous
  move to have no sense of key, cadence, or resting point in the music. I had
  come from Bach, Stravinsky, and jazz (particularly John Coltrane), all of which
  shared a very clear, demarcated pulse. I realized that if I were going to do
  anything that had the least emotional resonance for myself, I had to reinstate
  the pulse, front and center. Listening to a lot of non-Western music, as well
  as rock songs like Junior Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shotgun&rdquo; (which had one
  bass line throughout), and then performing with Terry Riley in his composition, <i>In
  C</i>, pushed me towards working with short melodic patterns, a style anathema
  to Stockhausen, Boulez, or Berio. It wasn&rsquo;t done as a political /historical
  gesture on my part &ndash;&rdquo;You&rsquo;ve done that, now I&rsquo;m going
  to do this.&rdquo;  Stravinsky said something to the effect that composers &ldquo;grub
  around for roots,&rdquo;  and I think that is absolutely accurate. It&rsquo;s
  an instinctual searching for what it is that gets you musically excited. Still,
  what I did instinctually turned out to be an historical marker. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: This constant, fixed pulse occurs in most of your pieces...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: In every piece...except for occasional tempo changes as you find them
  in <i>Different Trains</i>, for example. But a sense of pulse is a basic musical
  characteristic in all my compositions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: What about the notion of phasing, where a number of musical patterns result
  from going out of sync or phase with one another?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Phase really has to do with the canon, which is a technique going back
  in Western music to at least the thirteenth century. I picked it up mostly
  from some of the simpler piano pieces in Bartok&rsquo;s <i>Mikrokosmos </i>which
  I studied in the mid-&rsquo;50s. In my early tape pieces <i>It&rsquo;s Gonna
  Rain</i> and <i>Come Out</i>, you have one tape loop going and another identical
  loop slipping slightly behind the first one, and what you really have is a
  unison canon or round where the rhythmic interval between the first and second
  voices is variable and constantly changing. &ldquo;Phase&rdquo; was just a
  technical word I used at the time to refer to the function of the tape recorders.
  But once you looked at it musically you could understand it in terms of canons.
  By the time I wrote <i>Tehillim</i>, people noticed the canons because there
  were full-blown melodies, clearly perceived that way. But actually they were
  already there in <i>It&rsquo;s Gonna Rain</i>, <i>Come Out, Piano Phase, </i>and <i>Drumming.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: What strikes me about the canon is simply that all its material is the
  same material. So that the unity of creation is ingrained and inherent in the
  canonic process itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: That&rsquo;s true. You don&rsquo;t have to know what&rsquo;s going on
  to absorb it &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to know, say, that this is a canon
  at such and such an interval; you&rsquo;ll just feel the unity of it. It will
  have a subconscious effect on you. The reason why the canonic form is so durable
  is that people who aren&rsquo;t musicians, who don&rsquo;t know technically
  what&rsquo;s going on, just enjoy it. Its logic has an emotional appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: <i>When I listen to your phase pieces, I experience an enormous release
    of energy. The boundaries within which I usually hear things start shifting
    and I enter into a new realm, percecptually and psychologically. Also, the
    spatial notions of forward and backward, and up and down, at times reverse,
    so I experience a whole new way of listening.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>SR:</i> I discovered the phasing process by accident. I had two identical
  loops of a Pentecostal preacher, Brother Walter, whom I recorded in San Francisco&rsquo;s
  Union Square, saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna rain.&rdquo; I was playing with
  two inexpensive tape recorders&ndash;one mono jack of my stereo headphones
  plugged into tape recorder A, the other into tape recorder B. And I had intended
  to make a specific relationship: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna&rdquo; on one loop,
  against  &ldquo;rain&rdquo; on the other. Instead, the two recorders just happened
  to be lined up in unison, and one of them gradually started getting ahead of
  the other. The sensation I had in m head was that the sound moved over to my
  left ear, moved down to my left shoulder, down my left arm, down my leg, out
  across the floor to the left, and finally began to reverberate and shake and
  become the relationship I was looking for&ndash;&rdquo;It&rsquo;s gonna/It&rsquo;s
  gonna, rain/rain&rdquo;&ndash;and then started going in retrograde until it
  came back together in the center of my head. When I heard that, I realized
  it was more interesting than any one particular relationship because it was
  a process of gradually passing through all the canonic relationships making
  an entire piece and not just a moment in time. As you say, there&rsquo;s a
  logic of one voice moving ahead of the other, but in fact what you hear is,
  first the unison, then this kind of reverberation, then an irrational relationship
  that you can&rsquo;t pin down. You hear a lot of psychoacoustic fragments that
  you can organize in a lot of different ways. They&rsquo;re really there, but
  it&rsquo;s complicated because it&rsquo;s words and a pigeon&rsquo;s wings
  and traffic so that you begin hearing all kinds of things. Now, you&rsquo;re
  not hallucinating, it&rsquo;s really there, but it&rsquo;s all how you interpret
  the data. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: In this piece and in <i>Come Out</i> you transform words into rhythm and
  pure sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Every time there&rsquo;s a vowel there&rsquo;s a pitch. Black Pentecostal
  preaching hovers between speaking and singing, as you hear with Brother Walter.
  And what this method does is intensify it &ndash; it takes one little phrase,
  the vowel pitches and the consonant noises that go with them. As I recorded
  Brother Walter, a pigeon just took off near the microphone, and it sounds like
  a beating drum. You&rsquo;ve got a kind of drum beat resulting from the periodic
  beating of the pigeon&rsquo;s wings, a low rumble from the traffic going on
  in Union Square, and then you&rsquo;ve got Brother Walter&rsquo;s words &ndash; all
  of this going against itself at a slowly varying time rate. So it&rsquo;s very
  hard not to read into this all kinds of words and sounds you&rsquo;ve heard
  before, and this will vary from person to person. All music to some degree
  invites people to bring their own emotional life to it. My early pieces do
  that in an extreme form, but, paradoxically, they do so through a very organized
  process, and it&rsquo;s precisely the impersonality of that process that invites
  this very engaged psychological reaction. So people who considered it to be
  mechanical and impersonal...well, it&rsquo;s true; there&rsquo;s that aspect
  to it. What&rsquo;s interesting, however, is that the impersonality is precisely
  what seems to elicit a very strong personal human response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: When talking about your music, one might say, &ldquo;In the beginning
  was pulsation.&rdquo;  Couldn&rsquo;t one similarly say, &ldquo;In the beginning
  was the word&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR:&nbsp; I would never have said that until recently when I realized: <i>It&rsquo;s
    Gonna Rain, Come Out, Drumming, Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and
    Organ, Music for 18 Musicians, Tehillim, The Desert Music, Different Trains,
    The Cave, City Life, </i>and <i>Proverb</i>&ndash;they&rsquo;re all vocal
    pieces, though in very different ways. Sometimes they&rsquo;re recorded words,
    with or without instruments; sometimes it&rsquo;s singing words, sometimes
    it&rsquo;s vocalise. I realized that many of my best pieces do, in fact,
    use a singing or speaking voice. In Drumming, for instance, there&rsquo;s
    a relationship between singing and mallet percussion, where the women&rsquo;s
    voices imitate the sounds of marimbas. And then in <i>Different Trains</i>,
    the viola imitates the sound of a woman talking &ndash; the roles are reversed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: And the words, with a certain pressure put on them, sound like notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Exactly. &ldquo;From Chicago &ndash; dum de <i>dee</i> dum.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s <i>trompe
    l&rsquo;oreille</i>: first you hear the viola do it, and then you hear the
  woman speaking it with the viola.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the time I composed <i>It&rsquo;s
    Gonna Rain</i>, and even before then, I had a strong interest in contemporary
  American poetry &ndash; William Carlos Williams, Charles, Olson, and Robert
  Creeley, in particular. Back at Juilliard I tried to set them and it didn&rsquo;t
  work out. I was taking something that was alive and was just nailing it down.
  It seemed like taxidermy. Later I became interested in tape recorders, but
  not like the <i>musique concr&egrave;te </i>people who would record a car crash
  and run it through a ring modulator so that you&rsquo;d never hear it was a
  car crash. My criticism was that car crashes are loaded with emotional overtones,
  so start with that as a perceptible given and go from there. When I worked
  on a speech piece like <i>It&rsquo;s Gonna Rain</i>, the idea was to hear &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
  gonna rain.&rdquo; I recorded that in 1964, shortly after the Cuban missile
  crisis. I was in San Francisco then and thought we might be going up in so
  much radioactive smoke. With that hovering in the background and this preacher
  laying it down about the flood and Noah, it really had a lot of resonance.
  So I wanted people to hear the words; I didn&rsquo;t want to disguise them.
  Personally, at that time, I was going through a divorce, and the piece is&nbsp; extremely
  dark. The second part of the work is&nbsp; a much longer loop ending with Brother
  Walter&rsquo;s words about people knocking on the door of the ark &ndash; &ldquo;but
  it had been sealed by the hand of God&rdquo; &ndash; and the whole long loop
  doesn&rsquo;t reconstruct and come back together, it goes further and further
  out of phase until it is reduced to noise. The feeling is that&nbsp; you&rsquo;re
  experiencing what it&rsquo;s like to have everything completely dissolve into
  chaos.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the voice of individual
  speakers is not setting a text &ndash; it&rsquo;s setting a human being. A
  human being is personified by his or her voice. If you record me, my cadences
  and the way I speak are just as much me as any photograph of me. And when other
  people listen to that, they feel a persona present. So when that begins to
  spread and multiply and come apart as it does in <i>Its&rsquo;  Gonna Rain</i>,
  there&rsquo;s a very strong identification of a human being going through this
  uncommon magic. This is why in the late 1980s, just after my involvement with
  the orchestra in a piece like <i>The Four Sections</i>, I felt I needed to
  get back in contact with those early works. There was something important there
  and I couldn&rsquo;t let it go. Documentary reality still had material to be
  mined. And <i>Different Trains</i> was the first result of my return to documentary
  material, and then <i>The Cave</i> and <i>City Life</i>. My first use of the
  singing voice, on the other hand, occurs in <i>Drumming</i>, where the voices
  sing imitations of marimba patterns. That gets taken over in <i>Music for 18
    Musicians</i>, then reoccurs in <i>The Desert Music</i>. <i>Tehillim </i>is
  perhaps the most conventional of my pieces; I think it&rsquo;s also one of
  my best. It takes parts of the Psalms, a classical Western text, in the original
  Hebrew and uses a fairly large ensemble of traditional instruments and singers
  who sing the text in a very straightforward way, although it&rsquo;s complex
  rhythmically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: It&rsquo;s interesting that one of your most recent pieces, Proverb, takes
  as its text on aphorism by the philosopher Wittgenstein: &ldquo;How small a
  thought it takes to fill a whole life.&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t you write an undergraduate
  thesis on Wittgenstein?<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: [laughing]: Actually, I wrote a thesis criticizing Gilbert Ryle for criticizing
  Wittgenstein. When I wasn&rsquo;t drumming or listening to jazz or Stravinsky,
I spent my time in college reading Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What drew me to Wittgenstein
  was his idea that philosophical problems could be understood by looking at
  how we normally use language. For instance, the philosophical question, &ldquo;How
  can a mind (or soul) be inside a material body?&rdquo; is using the noun &ldquo;mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul&rdquo;  as
  if it were the same kind of noun as &ldquo;spoon&rdquo; or &ldquo;stone.&rdquo; Wittgenstein
  asks how we would teach a word like &ldquo;mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;soul&rdquo; to
  a child. In what &ldquo;language games&rdquo; would we use these words? This
  kind of close, subtle examination of everyday speech had a strong appeal to
  me.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to his text that I used
  in <i>Proverb</i>, I was trying to embody it in the piece. That is, the &ldquo;small
  thought&rdquo; is the idea of canon or round. By augmenting the subject of
  the canon, the melody, making it longer and longer, the canon gradually expands
  into slowly changing held tones &ndash; perhaps similar to <i>Four Organs</i>.
  Then within that unfolding canon the tenors weave their melismas on single
  syllables. Musically, the source of that kind of thing is P&egrave;rotin and
  the school of Notre Dame in the twelfth century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: When were you first aware that you were going to be a composer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR:&nbsp; I guess that first occurred in my fourteenth year. Until then, I
  had grown up without knowing any music prior to 1750 or after 1890, except
  for some Broadway shows, pop tunes, and pieces by George Gershwin. And in that
  year (it was 1950) I heard, within a few months of each other, recordings of
  Stravinsky&rsquo;s <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, Bach&rsquo;s <i>Brandenburg Concerto
  No. 5</i> and bebop by Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and the drummer Kenny Clarke.
  All of this music shared a rhythmic pulse, which Brahms and Mahler, for example,
  didn&rsquo;t; and it, or related pieces, had forms that were cyclical. A baroque
  figured bass is similar to jazz chord symbols, and both had a common practice
  so that if you knew the symbols you could improvise within that style.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seeds were definitely
  sown at that time. It was as if you had lived in a house until you were 14
  and someone said,  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one room you haven&rsquo;t seen, but
  now that you&rsquo;re fourteen you can see it.&rdquo; I was totally unaware
  of a musical world that was really the one I was supposed to live in. Western
  music before 1750 and from Debussy onwards, as well as jazz and non-Western
  music, are the sources from which I&rsquo;ve drawn almost everything.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At fourteen the flame was
  lit, and I immediately stopped studying the piano and took up the snare drum
  so I could form a jazz group with a pianist friend. But by the time I went
  to college I thought it was too late to become a composer &ndash; Mozart had
  been five, Bart&oacute;k had been six...and here I was already seventeen! At
  Cornell, however, I was encouraged by William Austin, with whom I studied music
  history and jazz analysis. And that was pivotal.&nbsp; I gave up my plans to
  study philosophy in graduate school at Harvard and went back to New York City
  in 1957 to study composition with Hall Overton and, later, at Juilliard. The
  bottom line though is that there was one thing in life that had the most powerful
  emotional effect on me, and that was music. This was true before I was fourteen,
  but at the age of fourteen it took a quantum leap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: I would think that almost anyone would take one of your most magnetic
  early pieces, Four Organs, which is the gradual augmentation of individual
  tones within a single chord, to be nothing less than an amazing wake-up call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: <i>Four Organs </i>is the longest V-I cadence in the history of Wester
  music. You&rsquo;ll find the chord in Debussy and Thelonius Monk-the tonic
  on the top and the dominant on the bottom. And it does have a wake-up quality.
  First of all, the piece is played on four screaming rock-and-roll organs, so
  the timbre is like talons on your ears. The high frequencies assault you, and
  the chord is like leaning forward &ndash; it&rsquo;s a dominant eleventh chord;
  it&rsquo;s going, so to speak, to the A, which is at the very top of the chord.
  And at the bottom is the E, which is saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the A!&rdquo; But
  the answer to the E is, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re already there!&rdquo; Then the E
  at the bottom gets removed, and little by little you remove all the thrust
  towards the A and are finally left with the A and a little E up on top, so
  you feel a kind of resolution. Meanwhile, you have the maracas sprinkling salt
  over the whole piece, constantly shaking out a growing number of eighth notes
  from the beginning to end. (The cycle goes from eleven beats at the beginning
  to 256 beats at the end.) So there&rsquo;s&nbsp; a sense of slow motion: something
  you heard that takes a few seconds gradually takes longer and longer. And you
  hear more and more melodic movement revealed as the chord pulls apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: People associate this feeling with being spaced out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Don&rsquo;t forget <i>Four Organs</i> was written in 1970, just after
  the &lsquo;60s. Younger musicians call it my &ldquo;punk piece.&rdquo; that&rsquo;s
  because of the instruments, the insistence, and the lack of harmonic variation  &ndash; there&rsquo;s
  one timbre and six pitches plus octave doublings, and that never changes. That
  was the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the early pieces &ndash; no change
  of harmony, pitch, or timbre &ndash; everything is the <i>same </i>timbre (four <i>identical </i>organs,
  two four, and eight <i>identical </i>loops in the speech pieces). In order
  to create this overall mix, everyone <i>had </i>&nbsp;to have the same timbre.
  It&rsquo;s an accoustical necessity if you want to get them all to mix and
  form one large musical web. All the changes are then rhythmic changes which
  end up creating melodic changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: Can you say something about the nature of time in your compositions? I
  always think of it as analogous to those digital clocks which zip by to the
  tenth of a second, while the hour markings go about their slow and kalpa-like
  periodicity. In your works, one can listen simultaneously to one piece to the
  rapidity of the whirling smaller intervals and/or relax and relate to the longer
  periodicities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: One piece this calls to mind is <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i>. One rhythmic
  measurement in the piece is the human breath. At the same time there are regular
  pulses being hammered out in the mallet instruments. So I had an image of myself
  and my musicians drumming on a beach so that the water washes up on all of
  us, and we&rsquo;re in our bare feet playing, and there are two kinds of time
  going on: the fixed, &ldquo;digital&rdquo; time on the drums; and the time
  that&rsquo;s washing up in the waves, which is more or less  &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; &ndash;more
  or less since wave number one washes up to a certain point on the beach, wave
  number two to another point, and so on. There&rsquo;s the digital metronome &ndash; that&rsquo;s
  an extreme form of regularity. As you go down, there&rsquo;s the human heartbeat,
  which fluctuates all the time (as it does in <i>City Life</i>), then there&rsquo;s
  breathing, which can become more irregular, the waves washing up on the beach,
  the earth&rsquo;s annual trip around the sun, and so on. And in <i>Music for
  18 Musicians</i>, this actually occurs as you listen: the human breath is a
  measure for the clarinets and singers, while the pulse in the mallet instruments
  (the quarter note equals about 208 on this recording) just goes on and on,
  and the two exist simultaneously. Likewise, in <i>Eight Lines</i>, the pianos
  never stop moving along in rapid eighth notes, the entire piece rests on that
  movement &ndash;  it&rsquo;s the <i>ground</i> on which the piece sits &ndash; but
  the strings are playing longer and longer held patterns that take up to ten
  bars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: In a sense, Indian music conveys this notion of time through cycles and
  drones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR:&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t a student of Indian music, but rather of West African
  and Balinese music. And I think there&rsquo;s a real analogy to what I&rsquo;m
  doing in Balinese gamelan music in which people play very fast-moving metallophones,
  but at the same time there are performers who sit in front of a large gong
  and make one stroke for every 64 beats. So there&rsquo;s a huge pause and large
  expanse of time that they literally mark off. That&rsquo;s what that music
  is all about &ndash; simultaneously related cycles of different lengths of
  64, 32, 16, 8, 4 beats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: Throughout your life you&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;grubbing for roots&rdquo; in
  the soils of different kinds of music from all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: When I was a kid, I was a drummer. Then at Juilliard I stopped playing
  trap drums, swept that under the rug, and tried to get back to the keyboard.
  At the end of my studies, I realized, however, that I wanted to keep my drumming
  part of what I was doing. I asked myself: In what tradition is percussion the
  dominant voice of the orchestra? (In our Western orchestra the dominant voice
  is the strings &ndash; count them.) And the answer was West Africa and Indonesia.
  So from 1970 through 1974, I proceeded to study both of those musics &ndash; I
  traveled to Ghana in 1970 and then later studied Balinese gamelan music in
  Seattle and Berkeley. And the question then arose: What do I do with this?
  What really interested me about this music was that it was put together in
  different ways from how Western music is generally constructed. Simply, Ghanaian
  drumming is constructed so that several repeating patterns, more or less in
  subdivisions of twelve, are superimposed so that their downbeats aren&rsquo;t
  in the same place. Back in 1965, wen I started the tape pieces and later the
  instrumental phase pieces, it was a similar situation: in the phase pieces,
  two or more players start off in unison but gradually player number two accelerates
  so that their downbeat is X number of beats ahead of the first player. This
  similarity to West African music was interesting to me (though there is no
  phasing in African music - or Balinese either). My conclusion was: rhythmic
  structure is what interests me in African and Balinese music, not the sound
  of the instruments.</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody grows up with a
  sound &ndash; the piano keyboard, for instance. We hear it from the time we&rsquo;re
  infants, and that tuning goes into our subconscious. You generally don&rsquo;t
  learn about contrapuntal structures like canons until you&rsquo;re older; that
  kind of thinking is much more abstract. Canons by Bach or Bart&oacute;k or
  Webern or by me have very little in common in terms of sound. What they do
  have in common is the structure &ndash;  there&rsquo;s a certain group of notes
  played once at this time and played again later at a certain rhythmic distance.
  How does it sound? You tell <i>me</i> how it sounds. What century are we in?
  But that durable technique has been around for at least 700 years and is still
  going strong. That&rsquo;s the kind of thinking&nbsp;  I apply to non-Western
  music. I want to think African, I want to think Balinese. I don&rsquo;t want
  to imitate their sound. George Harrison used the sitar in &ldquo;Norwegian
  Wood.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s so lastingly interesting.
  What&rsquo;s lasting about the Beatles is their ability to write great melodies.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I composed my phase pieces
  in the 1960s, I thought to myself: Is this Day One, am I on another planet,
  or is there some relationship between these tape and instrumental pieces and
  anything that&rsquo;s happened before in the history of music? And at that
  point I realized that my phase pieces were basically an unusual type of canon
  or round. And that thought made me feel very good; because it made me aware
  that I was varying something that&rsquo;s been around for a long time. To someone
  interested, as I was, in the history of music, it was very encouraging. And
  to find that those techniques or related ones, occurred not only in your own
  culture&rsquo;s music but also in the complicated polyphony of West African
  and Balinese music was even further encouragement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: Where did your musical path take you next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Music isn&rsquo;t notated in Africa or Bali &ndash; it&rsquo;s transmitted
  orally from one generation to the next. History in West Africa was also oral.
  And when I came back from West Africa I asked myself: Don&rsquo;t I have anything
  like that? And I thought: As a Jew I&rsquo;m a member of an ancient civilization,
  but I don&rsquo;t have the faintest idea of what it is I&rsquo;ve come from.
  I never got my birthright, so to speak. I grew up with no knowledge of Hebrew,
  the Torah or the chanting of the Torah, the commentaries, the law derived from
  it, or the mysticism that surrounds the law. It was paradoxically the study
  of West African and Balinese music that awakened my curiosity about my own
  cultural background. So I began studying Biblical Hebrew and Torah at a modern
  orthodox synagogue in New York City and then studied Hebrew cantillation with
  a cantor, which led to a trip to Israel where I met older me from Yemen, Kurdistan,
  Iraq, and Cochin, India, to listen to and to record how they chanted the opening
  of Genesis in Hebrew. That was the background that led me to set a Hebrew text,
  which I did in <i>Tehillim</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: So by following your musical path you became who you are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: Apparently so. Studying West African and Balinese music led me eventually
  to study my own ethnic background. People raised in the 1950s and &lsquo;60s,
  like myself, often felt they were &ldquo;without a home, a complete unknown&rdquo; &ndash; there
  was no ethnic underpinning. I simply had to discover where I came from, which
  was very satisfying and allowed me to learn things about Judaism that have
  become very important in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: So you traveled far...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR: ...and wound up looking under my own bed. Exactly. The non-Western studies
  led me back to myself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JC: There&rsquo;s an extraordinary moment in <i>Different Trains</i> where
  you hear the sounds of a train&rsquo;s whistle gradually transformed into an
  air-raid siren, and the words &ldquo;Chicago to New York&rdquo; transformed
  into  &ldquo;The Germans walked into Holland.&rdquo; The &ldquo;impersonal&rdquo; techniques
  in your early-process works here suddenly become both extremely personal and
  historical as the trains you took as a little boy from New York to Los Angeles
  become the death-trains of the European Holocaust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SR:&nbsp; <i>Different Trains</i> is partly an autobiographical piece. But
  when I first started work on it the only thing I knew was that I was going
  to use voices on a sampling keyboard and have the four string instruments doubling
  them...but I didn&rsquo;t know who was talking. First I thought: It&rsquo;s
  Bela Bart&oacute;k talking, and I got tapes of his voice, but did I want Bart&oacute;k
  sitting on my shoulder when I was writing a piece for string quartet? That
  was too much for me! So why not Ludwig Wittgenstein? No one had recordings
  of his voice. So then I thought of trying something closer to home. And those
  cross-country train rides I took between 1938 and 1941 when I was a child popped
  into my mind. I went out to Queens where my governess Virginia now lives and
  recorded her, then searched the sound archives to obtain the voices of Holocaust
  survivors. And the piece took off. It was my life. In those war years, boys
  like the one with his hands up in the famous photograph of the Warsaw ghetto
  were taking trains to Aushwitz, and they weren&rsquo;t around to talk anymore.
  There but for the grace of G-d...</p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, the particular is
  the path to the universal. Kurt Weill is a good example. <i>The Threepenny
    Opera</i> is absolutely the Weimar Republic: there&rsquo;s a banjo, a saxophone,
  trap drums &ndash; it&rsquo;s 1920s cabaret. If he had used a conventional
  orchestra, it would not have worked. It&rsquo;s terribly local and becomes
  a universal masterpiece that will live as long as there are musicians to perform
  it because Weill reveals where he was and what time it was. Another example:
  Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot are in Europe, while Dr. W.C. Williams is practicing
  medicine in Paterson, New Jersey, delivering the babies of Polish workers.
  Someone whom American Poetry has taken off from. I don&rsquo;t know how anyone
  can <i>try</i> to be universal. They way you really do it is to just take care
  of your own work, do the best job you can, be as truthful as possible about
  the things right under your nose. </p>
<p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the 1980s I
  felt I had to write <i>Different Trains</i>.&nbsp; Best to do what you&rsquo;ve
  been assigned to do. I&rsquo;ve been given my assignment, just as everyone
  has his or her assignment. And I want to take care of that because it&rsquo;s
  unique and I only have so many years to do it. So I just had to clarify what
  it was and then follow my musical intuition. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
  been doing.</p>
