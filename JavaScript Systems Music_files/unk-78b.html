      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BRIAN ENO was a founding member of ROXY
        MUSIC, the English band that more or less founded the Fine Art - Fashion
        - Rock and Roll fusion that continues to make the world a more
        interesting spot. And while Bryan Ferry was Roxy&#146;s front man, Eno
        was the band&#146;s focal point - supplying the most radical musical and
        visual input.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">After a couple of historic Roxy albums,
        Eno left to pursue his own directions, which proved to be more radical,
        innovative, and eventually, successful than Roxy. He has made four
        avant-pop solo albums: HERE COME THE WARM JETS (1973); TAKING TIGER
        MOUNTAIN (BY STRATEGY) (1974); ANOTHER GREEN WORLD (1975); and BEFORE
        AND AFTER SCIENCE (1977). None of these has been a major chart hit, but
        all of them have aged well, sounding as fresh and revolutionary today as
        when they were made, and selling even better. More than any other pop
        artist, Eno has bridged the gap between &#147;serious music,&#148; the
        techno-avant garde, and &#147;fun music,&#148; music that you can dance
        to.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The solo albums explore many forms -
        from hard rockers to minimal mood pieces, to robot disco - but none of
        them are strictly definable, perhaps because they&#146;ve been arrived
        at in strange ways. Among the instruments played by Eno on his solo
        albums are: snake guitar, piano, synthesizer, digital guitar, vibes,
        bells, castanet guitar, synthetic percussion, club guitar, uncertain
        piano, tapes, electric larynx, etc.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Eno has collaborated on two albums with
        ROBERT FRIPP, the former lead guitarist with KING CRIMSON: NO
        PUSSYFOOTING (1973); and EVENING STAR (1976). He has performed live with
        various assemblages of musicians, resulting in two live LPs, 801 LIVE (a
        Roxy spinoff with Phil Manzanera), and JUNE 1, 1974 (with Kevin Ayers,
        John Cale, Nico et al..) He has produced one album of muzak for the
        bright, Discreet Music (1975).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Perhaps Eno&#146;s funniest work is his
        production of the PORTSMOUTH SINFONIA, a symphony orchestra composed
        largely of musicians who can&#146;t play, but make a fabulous try anyway
        on such numbers as &#147;The William Tell Overture&#148; and &#147;Also
        Spake Zarathusra.&#148; But lately, Eno&#146;s come into great demand as
        a &#147;serious&#148; producer and he has worked with the English &#147;new
        wave&#148; group ULTRAVOX, and most recently the TALKING HEADS, New York&#146;s
        favorite &#147;art band,&#148; and DEVO (the Devolution Band), a big
        favorite of David Bowie and Akron, Ohio.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">And probably Brian Eno&#146;s greatest &#147;claim
        to fame&#148; is his collaboration with David Bowie on the latter&#146;s
        latter two platters, LOW and &#147;HEROES,&#148; which have greatly
        extended the boundaries of pop music.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I began talking with Eno about Oblique
        Strategies, which is an &#147;oracular&#148; deck of cards he designed
        with artist Peter Schmidt for the purpose of solving problems in
        artistic processes.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">How did you devise Oblique
        Strategies?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">They have quite a long history. When I
        was at art school I started making programs or devices to extricate
        myself from rapt situations while I was painting. You often find
        yourself in a situation where your focus on detail is so concentrated
        that your actual overview of the whole disappears and you&#146;ve lost
        any possibility of stepping outside and seeing it as a complete thing.
        </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The idea of Oblique Strategies was just
        to dislocate my vision for a while. By means of performing a task that
        might seem absurd in relation to the picture, one can suddenly come at
        it from a tangent and possibly reassess it. So I had about five or six
        little principles that I carried in my head at that time. Then when Roxy
        started and we made our first album, although I liked the album a lot,
        as soon as we had finished it and I was in a position of sitting at home
        and listening to it as a record, I began thinking &#147;If only I&#146;d
        done this, or that.&#148; I could suddenly see lots of places where a
        slightly more detached vision or a different angle of approach would
        have made a lot of difference. So the next time we recorded, I compiled
        a set of about twenty five little cards which I&#146;d just stick around
        the studio and keep reminding myself of all the time. They were the kind
        of ideas that are in Oblique Strategies. Many of them still survive in
        the pack that is extant now. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The kind of panic situation you get
        into in the studio is unreal. It doesn&#146;t always profit the music.
        You&#146;ve got until eight o&#146;clock and you&#146;ve got to get
        something finished. You tend to proceed in a very linear fashion. Now if
        that line isn&#146;t going in the right direction, no matter how hard
        you work you&#146;re not going to get anywhere. The function of the
        cards was to constantly question whether that direction was correct. To
        say &#147;How about going that way?&#148; Since then every time I&#146;ve
        gone into a recording studio I&#146;ve found myself adding to them. I
        would later find other little principles that became useful.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Later I showed them to my friend Peter
        Schmidt, the painter, and he said &#147;Oh, I&#146;ve been doing a
        similar thing.&#148; And he showed me a notebook he had, which had on
        each page a comparable aphorism or idea. Many of the ones he had were
        identical to mine. So we compiled them and then sat down and invented
        some more. We began to recognize that this could be a working
        proposition, and we finally published them in a very small edition.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">They&#146;re still useful. One would
        think that after a while their ability to disturb a procedure would
        pale, but it hasn&#146;t happened to me. I&#146;ve chucked a few out of
        the deck because they&#146;re of no use anymore, but there are still
        about ninety I use.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><I>Have you ever used the <B>I Ching?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Yes, it was about the time when I was
        getting interested in that that I also got interested in the Oblique
        Strategies idea. And of course, all those oracles work in the same way.
        You can either believe that they carry intrinsic wisdom of some kind, or
        you can believe that they work on a purely behavioral level, simply
        adjusting your perception at a point, or suggesting a different
        perception. Or you can believe a blend of both.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The Oblique Strategy was an attempt to
        make a set that was slightly more specific, tailored to a more
        particular situation than the <I>I Ching</I>, which is tailored to
        cosmic situations, though I suppose that with sufficient skill one could
        use the <I>I Ching</I> in the same way.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Do you pick cards at random, or do
        you look through the deck until you see one that strikes you as relevant
        to the situation?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I always pick at random. Other people
        sort through them, but I never use them unless I come to a point where a
        piece isn&#146;t getting anywhere and needs help. When I work there are
        two distinct phases: the phase of pushing the work along, getting
        something to happen, where all the input comes from me, and phase two,
        where things start to combine in a way that wasn&#146;t expected or
        predicted by what I supplied. Once phase two begins everything is ok,
        because then the work starts to dictate its own terms. It starts to get
        an identity which demands certain future moves. But during the first
        phase you often find that you come to a full stop. You don&#146;t know
        what to supply. And it&#146;s at that stage that I will pull one of the
        cards out.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Later on you might be faced with a
        number of options that seem equally desirable - again I might pull one
        out rather than try all the options. I&#146;ve used them on nearly every
        record I&#146;ve made.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Do you write methodically?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">All kinds of different ways. I don&#146;t
        have a technique, one way of working. I suppose broadly they fall into
        three or four different categories. One is the traditional category - I
        have a tape recorder like yours (micro-cassette) and I always have it
        with me. I might be walking along and I&#146;ll think of a rhythm or a
        melody or a series of words or some little idea that I&#146;ll note on
        it. I have thousands of those notes in fact. Then I&#146;ll go through
        them all and see if any of them fit together. After that they go into a
        kind of demo stage and into my tape library where I attempt to keep them
        in some kind of order, which is very difficult because I don&#146;t know
        what to call them or how to classify them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Just as frequently, I go straight into
        the studio and see what&#146;s around. I might hire a couple of
        instruments that I&#146;ve never used - maybe a particular type of
        electronic organ or an echo unit. Then I just dabble with sounds until
        something starts to happen that suggests a texture. The texture suggests
        some kind of mood, and the mood suggests some kind of lyric. That&#146;s
        like working in reverse, often quite the other way around, from sound to
        song. Although often they stop before they get to the song stage.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Another way of working is setting
        deliberate constraints that aren&#146;t musical ones - like saying &#147;Well,
        this piece is going to be three minutes and nineteen seconds long and it&#146;s
        going to have changes here, here and here, and there&#146;s going to be
        a convolution of events here, and there&#146;s going to be a very fast
        rhythm here with a very slow moving part over the top of it.&#148; Those
        are the sort of visual ideas that I can draw out on graph paper. I&#146;ve
        done a lot of film music this way.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Another way - I have to enumerate
        these, because I use them all about equally often - is to gather
        together a group of musicians who wouldn&#146;t normally work together,
        perhaps...</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Someone told me that you use
        musicians that actually didn&#146;t like one another.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">No, there wasn&#146;t a personal enmity
        between them. They weren&#146;t hostile toward each other, but they were
        definitely from schools of music that were not compatible. One of them
        was from Hawkweed, another one was Phil Collins from Genesis, and
        certainly those two are quite far apart, and then Robert Fripp (formerly
        of King Crimson) on top of that, and then myself, who&#146;s somewhere
        else again, and another guy who played in a kind of spoof rock band -
        they used to do covers of early Fifties songs. One way of working is
        just bring that group together and encourage them to stick to their
        guns, not to do the thing that normally happens in a working situation
        where everyone homogenizes and concedes certain points - so eventually
        they&#146;re playing in roughly the same style. I wanted quite the
        opposite of that. I wanted them to accent their styles, so that they
        pulled away. So there would be a kind of space in the middle where I
        could operate, and attempt to make these things coalesce on some way. In
        fact quite a lot of my stuff has arisen from that.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I have also worked from very
        mathematical and structural bases, but in general that hasn&#146;t been
        so successful.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><I>Do you mean <B>Discreet Music?</B></I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">No, that was done in a very peculiar
        way. There&#146;s no other piece I&#146;ve done that&#146;s like that.
        The reason for doing that was that Fripp and I were going to do some
        concerts and I wanted to compile some tapes that would be used for
        drones for us to work on top of. They were just ambiance tapes really.
        That particular day it was getting close to the beginning of the tour
        and I wanted to get quite a lot of these done, so we had a lot of
        choices. I set that particular system up, that involved a delay system
        up that I&#146;ve been using for quite a long time, and a
        self-programming synthesizer, which has a built in memory so it can play
        a melodic line over and over. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Once I got it going the phone started
        ringing, people started knocking on the door, and I was answering the
        phone and adjusting all this stuff as it ran. I almost made that without
        listening to it. It was really automatic music. The next day Fripp came
        round and we were going through these things I&#146;d made and I put
        that one on by accident at half speed and it sounded very, very good. I
        thought it was probably one of the best things I&#146;d ever done and I
        didn&#146;t even realize I was doing it at the time. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Since then I&#146;ve experimented with
        a lot of procedures where I set something up and interfered as little as
        possible. In fact I try to distract myself. I have techniques that keep
        my fingers off. I had a piece where I wanted a particular sound to come
        in at irregular intervals and I didn&#146;t know how to decide what
        these points should be. I didn&#146;t want to do it at a &#147;nice
        place&#148; - I wanted some more arbitrary technique. So I set the
        synthesizer up and then I placed these obstacles around the studio, and
        walked around them by different routes. Each time I passed the
        synthesizer I would hit it on whatever beat it happened to be closest
        to. That was another technique for suspending taste. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I think I&#146;ve forgotten your
        question.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">You started out describing your
        more structural approaches. Is there anything you&#146;ve done recently
        that&#146;s an example of that method?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Yeah, but it&#146;s not released. There&#146;s
        a new series I&#146;ve done of music designed for airports. It&#146;s
        called <I>Music for Airports</I> in fact. I&#146;m going to release it
        on my own label.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Is it like muzak?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">That&#146;s right, but really beautiful
        too. I&#146;m very, very pleased with one of the pieces. Again, it was
        done with a minimum of good intentions. I didn&#146;t go into it
        thinking I&#146;m going to make a very interesting piece of music here.
        I went into it thinking I just wanted to make something that would <I>work</I>
        in an airport, that would actually make you think that flying was a
        pleasant thing to do instead of an unbearably uncomfortable thing, as I
        think it generally is. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The particular piece I&#146;m referring
        to was done by using a whole series of very long tape loops, like fifty,
        sixty, seventy feet long. there were twenty-two loops. One loop had just
        one piano note on it. Another one would have two piano notes. Another
        one would have a group of girls singing one note, sustaining it for ten
        seconds. There are eight loops of girls&#146; voices, and about fourteen
        loops of piano. I just set all of these loops running and let them
        configure in whichever way they wanted to, and in fact the result is
        very, very nice. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The interesting thing is that it doesn&#146;t
        sound at all mechanical or mathematical as you would imagine. It sounds
        like some guy is sitting there playing the piano with quite intense
        feeling. The spacing and dynamics of &#147;his&#148; playing sound very
        well organized. That was an example of hardly interfering at all. When
        the piece was finished I listened to it and there was just one piano
        note I didn&#146;t like. It seemed to appear in the wrong place, so I
        simply edited it out. A lot of the so-called systems composers have this
        thing that the system is always right. You don&#146;t fiddle with it at
        all. Well, I don&#146;t think like that. I think that the system is as
        right as you judge it to be. If for some reason you don&#146;t like a
        bit of it you must trust your intuition on that. I don&#146;t take a
        doctrinaire approach to systems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><I>Do you not read and write music by
        choice? I wouldn&#146;t think it would be that useful for you.</I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> It wouldn&#146;t be very useful for
        me. There have been one or two occasions where I was stuck somewhere
        without my tape recorder and had an idea, tried to memorize it, and
        since a good idea nearly always relies on some unfamiliar nuance it is
        therefore automatically hard to remember. so on those very rare
        occasions I&#146;ve thought, &#147;God, if only I could write this down.&#148;
        But in fact, quite a lot of what I have to do has to do with sound
        texture, and, you can&#146;t notate that anyway. You can&#146;t notate
        the sound of &#147;St. Elmo&#146;s Fire.&#148; There&#146;s no way of
        writing that down. That&#146;s because musical notation arose at a time
        when sound textures were limited. If you said violins and woodwind that
        defined the sound texture; if you say synthesizer and guitar it means
        nothing - you&#146;re talking about 28,000 variables.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">What also happens with notation is that
        it reduces things to a language which isn&#146;t necessarily appropriate
        to them. In the same way that words do, you get a much cruder version of
        what was intended. If you think of the way a composer or say a pop
        arranger works - he has an idea and he writes it down, so there&#146;s
        one transmission loss. Then he gives the score to a group of musicians
        who interpret that, so there&#146;s another transmission loss. And then
        they play it which is another transmission loss. So he&#146;s involved
        with three information losses. Whereas what I nearly always do is work
        directly with the sound, and I respond directly with the sound if it
        doesn&#146;t sound right. So there&#146;s a continuous loop going on.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">You know that in order to copyright
        material somebody has to write it down for you. Any piece of recorded
        material has to be scored in order for it to be copyrighted. I&#146;ve
        seen the scores of my things and they don&#146;t resemble the music in
        any way. If you gave them to somebody who has never heard the music and
        say &#147;What does this sound like to you?&#148; they&#146;ll play you
        something that has no relationship with the music it derives from.
        Notation simply isn&#146;t adequate.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">How do you work as a producer? How
        much do you add?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">As much as anyone will let me, really.
        No, I work in various ways depending on what seems to be necessary.
        There are cases where it&#146;s best to just keep your hands off and
        leave it alone. There are other cases where it isn&#146;t so. When I was
        working with Talking Heads what would happen typically is that they
        would go out and start playing a track, and I would always run the tape.
        I always record everything, even a run through where you&#146;re trying
        to get in tune. That&#146;s a principle, because sometimes when the
        situation isn&#146;t clear interesting things happen, and they are worth
        listening to again. I would also have my synthesizer permanently linked
        into the control desk and I would sit in the control room next to the
        engineer, so I could feed any instrument through as they were playing,
        and what I did would also go on tape. I was kind of listening to what
        they were doing and picking out sounds and making new sounds from them.
        Instead of adding an instrument, which is the traditional overdubbing
        idea, I was extracting ideas and rhythmic parts from what they were
        playing, perhaps using delays to create new rhythms within their own.
        Then they would come in and listen and we would select the interesting
        parts and that would become the basis for the next time 'round. This
        didn&#146;t always happen. There were some things that were first take.
        But sometimes we would continuously listen very carefully and pick up
        little playing ideas that may have been accidents, or accidents of
        interaction, and using those as the basis of doing it again. That would
        get the basic track down. Then listening to this track you might find a
        dead area where there was nothing much happening, so we&#146;d try
        chopping things out. There are two tracks on the album that radically
        changed their shape because of that. After that the overdubbing phase
        would start, which would involve whatever additions seemed to be
        necessary.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">How do you keep up with the latest
        electronic devices? Do you do a lot of shopping?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">No, I don&#146;t go shopping that much.
        I always wok in studios that have all the gimmicks. There are hundreds
        of manufacturers always producing devices that in general do the same
        things. Since they have slight structural differences if you take one
        and fool around with it and give it a good kick it will actually do some
        thing that it wasn&#146;t designed to do. I have this relationship with
        my synthesizers. I&#146;ve had them for so long, and I&#146;ve never has
        them serviced, so that now practically all of their functions operate
        differently from what they were designed to do. They do very interesting
        things now, but that means nobody else can use them either. They&#146;re
        not reliable in the strict sense. But with devices my technique is
        always to hide the hand in a drawer until I&#146;ve played with a while.
        The handbook always tells you what it does, and you can be quite sure
        that if it&#146;s a complex device it can do fifteen other things that
        weren&#146;t predicted in the handbook, or that they didn&#146;t
        consider desirable. It&#146;s normally those other things that interest
        me.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Do you have a trick bag that you
        carry around with you?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">For the Talking Heads album I brought a
        couple of things. I brought my little synthesizer that fits into a
        suitcase - it&#146;s completely wacky, it does a whole lot of things
        that nothing else can do as far as I know. It&#146;s actually
        degenerated over the six years or so that I&#146;ve owned it and become
        a really unique and interesting piece of electronics. But I mostly used
        the studio devices, because I knew what they had. Generally I find I&#146;m
        happy to use whatever&#146;s around. If there&#146;s nothing there I&#146;ll
        make something. For example, one of the things I tried doing was getting
        a tiny loudspeaker and feeding the instruments off the tape through this
        tiny speaker and then through this long plastic tube - about 50 feet
        long - that they used to clean out the swimming pool in the place where
        I was staying. You get this really hollow, cavernous, weird sound - a
        very nice sound. We didn&#146;t use it finally, but nonetheless we well
        could have.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Are the German studios you have
        used better equipped than the English and American studios?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Technically they&#146;re incredibly
        good. The popular idea of German technical efficiency is really true. At
        the studio we were working at there was a guy called Juergen Kramer who&#146;s
        quite extraordinary. Have you ever seen a film called <I>The Enigma of
        Kaspar Hauser </I> or <I>Stroszek</I> - there&#146;s a man in those
        films who used to be a lavatory cleaner and Werner Herzog decided he
        wanted him to act in his films. He plays a sort of dementoid creature.
        Well Juergen Kramer is rather like that, sort of a country bumpkin. But
        he has an extraordinary intuitive grasp of very, very complex electronic
        systems. We were working on an MCI computerized desk, which is really a
        very complex desk, and occasionally it would go wrong. And he would walk
        in and say &#147;Ja, what ees da trobble? Ah, I think it&#146;s the
        capacitor in this module.&#148; And he&#146;d rip things out and start
        pulling them apart. &#147;Ja, here ees da trobble!&#148; He would fix
        things in ten minutes that would honestly take any other technician half
        a day to fix. He had an intuition I&#146;ve never seen in anyone before.
        And in fact, when Conny Plank who owns the studio first got this MCI
        desk, Juergen went through all the circuits and so on, saying &#147;This
        could be better... this could be improved... this function should work
        like this.&#148; He redesigned a lot of the functions, and MCI came over
        and saw his redesigns and incorporated them in all future models. And
        the MCI team is <I>not</I> made up of dummies. In fact the team is made
        up of people who were involved in designing the Apollo missions and when
        that was closed down quite a few of them went over to MCI. They&#146;re
        really the best brains. This guy Juergen Kramer is really an
        unbelievable person. His whole personality is typified, I think, that he
        takes as many sugars in his tea as the tea will take. He puts in sugar
        until he has a saturated liquid. </FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">When you collaborated with Bowie on
        <B>Low</B> was the instrumental side worked out in advance, or was it
        conceived in the studio?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The pieces all have slightly different
        histories. &#147;Weeping Wall&#148; and &#147;Subterraneans&#148; were
        originally done as part of the soundtrack of <I>The Man Who Fell to
        Earth</I>, but for contractual reasons they weren&#146;t used. So we
        took those tracks and worked on top of those. Actually, I didn&#146;t
        work on &#147;Weeping Wall&#148; at all. Then there were two days when
        David had to go to Paris because he was being sued by someone, so rather
        than wasting the studio time I decided to start a piece on my own, with
        the understanding that if he didn&#146;t like it I&#146;d use it myself
        or something. I just couldn&#146;t face wasting the studio time. So I
        started working on that piece and in fact all the instrumentation was
        finished when David got back, and he put the vocals on top. That was &#147;Warszawa.&#148;
        It was a very clear division of labor. The other piece was &#147;Art
        Decade.&#148; That started off as a little tune he played on the piano.
        Actually we both played it because it was for four hands, and when we&#146;d
        finished it he didn&#146;t like it very much and sort of forgot about
        it. But as it happened, during the two days he was gone I finished the
        one piece and then dug that out to see if I could do anything with it. I
        put all those instruments on top of what we had, and then he liked it
        and realized there was hope for it, and he worked on top of that, adding
        more instruments. In fact, &#147;Art Decade&#148; is my favorite track
        of all.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">On <I>&#147;Heroes&#148;</I> it wasn&#146;t
        as clear cut because we both worked on all the pieces all the time -
        almost taking turns. We used Oblique Strategies quite a lot. On one of
        the pieces - &#147;Sense of Doubt&#148; - we both pulled an Oblique
        Strategy at the beginning and kept them to ourselves. It was like a
        game. We took turns working on it; he&#146;d do one overdub and I&#146;d
        do the next, and he&#146;d do the next. The idea was that each was to
        observe his Oblique Strategy as closely as he could. And as it turned
        out they were entirely opposed to one another. Effectively mine said &#147;Try
        to make everything as similar as possible.&#148; which in effect is
        trying to create a homogeneous line, and his said &#147;Emphasize
        differences&#148; so whereas I was trying to smooth it out and make it
        into one continuum he was trying to do the opposite.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><I>On your last album, on Bowie&#146;s
        last few albums, and on Kraftwerk&#146;s last two albums, there&#146;s
        danceable yet advanced music. Do you think about breaking through to the
        discos?</I></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Oh yeah, I do. What I would really like
        to do, if I could have a sort of kingship for a short time and organize
        the group of my dreams - I would make one group which was a combination
        of, say, Parliament and Kraftwerk - put those two together and say &#147;Make
        a record.&#148; Something like that would be an extraordinary
        combination: the weird physical feeling of Parliament, with this
        strange, rigid, stiff stuff over the top of it.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">You get a bit of that with Donna
        Summer.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">That&#146;s right. Donna Summer was
        actually the beginning of this idea for me. When I heard that record I
        was so knocked out, I thought it was really making progress. Because to
        me a lot of the most interesting things in electronic music have come
        from that area - they haven&#146;t come from people who are dealing with
        electronics exclusively. They&#146;ve come from people who are searching
        for gimmicks, something as banal as &#147;What kind of sound can we get
        now that nobody&#146;s ever got before?&#148; What I like about the
        Parliament/ Funkadelic people is that they really go to extremes. There&#146;s
        nothing moderate about what they do. It&#146;s very extreme music, quite
        as extreme in some ways as Kraftwerk is. What I&#146;m interested in
        doing is getting these two extremes and gluing them together, seeing
        what you have to do to make them work together.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The other thing I&#146;m interested in
        doing now is robot reggae. I&#146;d like to get together with some
        reggae musicians and deliberately try to subtract the feel from what
        they&#146;re doing so that they play in a kind of really stiff white
        way.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Dub is a step in that direction.
        Some of it is quite abstract.</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">That&#146;s right. Again there&#146;s
        an incredibly extreme and interesting and sophisticated use of
        electronics that nobody seems to notice. They don&#146;t notice that it&#146;s
        electronic music. They always focus on people like me who use
        synthesizers, right, which are explicitly electronic and therefore
        obvious. &#147;Ah yes, that&#146;s electronic music.&#148; But they don&#146;t
        realize that so is this concept of actually taking a piece of extant
        music and literally re-collaging it, taking chunks out and changing the
        dynamics and creating new rhythmic structures with echo and all that.
        That&#146;s real electronic music as far as I&#146;m concerned. I&#146;ve
        got plans to do a dub album actually.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Have you ever seen dub in the
        making?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Yes, I have. I did a bit in Nassau.
        While I was there an engineer named Carl Peterson was working on Althea
        and Donna&#146;s album. I know him and went in one day as he was setting
        the track up and said &#147;Can I try it?&#148; I&#146;d always really
        wanted to, and I started switching things and doing things and it really
        works with reggae. It&#146;s so easy. I tried doing it with rock music
        and it doesn&#146;t happen. You can&#146;t just play the board. I
        suppose it&#146;s because all the instruments are rhythm instruments, so
        that whatever&#146;s left is still playing rhythm. Whereas with rock you
        have a division of rhythm instruments, melody instruments and vocal
        lines. But with reggae it&#146;s very easy. In fact I actually went to
        the extent of trying to make mistakes, trying to do it so it didn&#146;t
        work, to see how far off you could get. I&#146;d hit things off the beat
        or bring in quite the wrong instruments or have echoes of the wrong
        length, and it still sounded all right. It&#146;s like magic. It&#146;s
        like sculpture in fact. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Whereas most of the techniques of
        Western engineering as opposed to Jamaican engineering are additive,
        like painting, where you build something up. But Reggae is like
        sculpture. You have something and you chop stuff away until you&#146;re
        left with the shape you want. There&#146;s a record by Dr. Alimentado
        called &#147;Life All Over&#148; that&#146;s one of the great dub
        records of all time. It&#146;s so bizarre, because apart from anything
        else he&#146;s set up an echo which isn&#146;t a simple one. The echo is
        two thirds of a beat long, so it forms incredibly peculiar cross
        rhythms. And they work. It&#146;s a funny physical feeling. It&#146;s
        like some weird waltz time over this very distinctive reggae.</FONT></P>
      <P><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">What do you think about flying
        saucers?</FONT></I></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I wish there was a serious
        investigation of them that wasn&#146;t conducted by crackpots.
        Unfortunately nearly all the people who are interested in them kind of
        manufacture the evidence to fit the theories rather than the other way
        around. So it&#146;s very hard to find any dispassionate treatment of
        them. Maybe there isn&#146;t any scientific basis in which case that&#146;s
        why you never see any scientific evidence.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I saw one when I was young, you know.
        When I was seven I saw a flying saucer over our house. It was visible
        for quite a long time, four or five minutes. It wasn&#146;t a saucer; it
        was sort of a cigar shaped thing. Having seen this I forgot about it.
        Which might sound strange, but I did actually forget about it for many
        years. And I remembered it with quite a start one day and I thought &#147;Now
        do I really remember this, or did I manufacture this memory?&#148; So I
        wrote to my sister who had moved to America a long time before and
        mentioned it as a very vague question: &#147;Do you remember whether we
        ever saw anything in the sky together? if you do, describe it.&#148; She
        wrote back and described it exactly as I had remembered it, so I figured
        that I had actually seen it unless we mutually manufactured this myth.
        So I&#146;m prepared to believe in their existence, or in a phenomenon
        strong enough to create the impression of their existence in your head.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
